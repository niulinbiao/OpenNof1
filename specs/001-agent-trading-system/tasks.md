## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Phase 3 (Market Data) must be complete before Phase 4 (AI Agent)
  - Phase 4 (AI Agent) should be complete before Phase 5 (Trading Execution)
  - Phase 5 (Trading) should be complete before Phase 6 (Monitoring)
- **Testing (Phase 7)**: Depends on all implementation phases being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 2 (Phase 3)**: Market Data - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 4)**: AI Agent - Depends on Phase 3 Market Data
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Trading Execution - Depends on Phase 4 AI Agent decisions
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Monitoring - Depends on all previous stories for data

### Within Each Phase

- Implementation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Verification tasks should be done after implementation tasks complete
- Each phase includes a verification checkpoint

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Within each user story, implementation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

2. **Phase 2**: Build foundational framework
3. **Phase 3**: Get market data flowing
4. **Phase 4**: Add AI decision making (MVP!)
5. **Phase 5**: Implement real trading execution
6. **Phase 6**: Build monitoring dashboard
7. **Phase 7**: Add comprehensive testing and optimization

### Verification Checkpoints

Each phase ends with a verification task:

- **T020**: Real-time market data retrieval
- **T033**: AI decision generation
- **T043**: Real trading execution
- **T056**: Monitoring dashboard display
- **T065**: Final system validation

### MVP First (Phase 1-4)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL)
3. Complete Phase 3: Market Data Processing
4. Complete Phase 4: AI Agent Decision Making
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Full AI decision pipeline working
6. Deploy/demo AI agent with mock trading execution

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each phase should be independently completable and verifiable
- Each phase ends with a verification checkpoint
- Testing tasks consolidated in Phase 7
- Focus on working implementation first, testing last
- Logical flow: Market Data → AI Decisions → Trading Execution → Monitoring
